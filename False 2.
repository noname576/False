A parameter array (params array) allows a method to accept a variable number of arguments. It enables passing multiple values of the same type as a single array parameter.
 A reference parameter allows a method to modify the value of an argument by passing its reference rather than a copy.
 Mandatory parameters must be provided when calling a method. They do not have default values and are necessary for the function to execute correctly.
Method overloading allows multiple methods with the same name but different parameter lists. 
An optional parameter has a default value and can be omitted when calling a method.
File-Processing Classes in .NET. 
•	StreamReader: Reads characters from a stream.
•	StreamWriter: Writes characters to a stream.
•	FileStream: Handles file reading and writing at the byte level.
•	BinaryReader: Reads binary data from a stream.
•	BinaryWriter: Writes binary data to a stream.

5 OOP Features/Concepts.
1.	Encapsulation: Wrapping data and methods into a single unit (class).
2.	Inheritance: Creating a new class from an existing class.
3.	Polymorphism: Methods behaving differently based on input (overloading & overriding).
4.	Abstraction: Hiding complex implementation details.
5.	Classes & Objects: Core concepts of OOP.

Inheritance in C# allows a child class to inherit and reuse a parent class’s properties and methods.
Polymorphism in C# allows a single method or object to take many different forms and behave differently.
Encapsulation in C# is the practice of keeping an object's details hidden and only allowing access through specific methods.
Abstraction in C# means hiding the complex details and only showing the necessary parts.
A base class in C# is a parent class that provides methods and attributes that can be inherited and reused by derived (child) classes.
A derived class is a child class that gets features from a parent class and can have its own extra features.

Method overloading is when a class has multiple methods with the same name but different inputs.

Method overriding is when a child class changes the behavior of a method it inherits from a parent class.
Exception handling is a way to catch and fix errors in a program so it doesn’t crash.
A try block is used to write code that might cause an error, so the program can handle it safely.
A catch block is used to handle errors that occur in the try block and specify what to do if an error happens.
A finally block is used to write code that will run whether or not an error occurs, usually for cleanup tasks like closing files.
Ref parameters allow a method to modify the value of a variable passed to it, and the change is reflected outside the method.
Out parameters are similar to ref parameters, but they are used to return a value from a method, and the variable must be assigned inside the method.
Static methods are methods that belong to the class and can be used without making an object of that class.
Virtual methods are methods in a base class that can be changed or overridden in a derived class.
An abstract class is a class that can't be used to create objects directly and is meant to be inherited by other classes.
A sealed class is a class that can't be inherited or extended by any other class.
Constructors are special methods that are called when an object is created, used to initialize the object’s properties.
Destructors are methods that clean up when an object is no longer needed.
